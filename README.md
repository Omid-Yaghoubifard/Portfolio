## **My Portfolio Website**

This is my first portfolio project. It is a full-stack and fully responsive web application that will help me showcase my present and future projects in a very user-friendly manner. The web app also includes an admin panel to help me add and remove projects without constantly modifying the source code.

Although I studied tens of high-quality portfolios from other developers before designing and developing this project I made sure my portfolio is unique and stands out as an excellent portfolio web application.

The web app has many pages in the admin panel, but to the public it seems like a single-page website. I think a single-page design of the portfolio makes it more desirable for the user to scroll through my projects, see my abilities as a developer, and contact me if needed.
